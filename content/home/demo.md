### ðŸ‘‹ Welcome 

<i>Re</i>:Presentations is a series of online seminars on political representation, organised by [Lucy Kinski](https://representations.netlify.app/author/lucy-kinski/) and [Resul Umit](https://representations.netlify.app/author/resul-umit/). 

The series aspires to facilitate an inclusive, supportive, and dynamic environment in which scholarly work on anything representation can be discussed.

### Inclusive

By the virtue of being online, <i>Re</i>:Presentations removes the budgetary constraints over attendance to academic events. In addition, the series aims to be inclusive in terms of who presents and what is presented.

We therefore encourage those who are less likely to be seen at conferences --- including, but not limited to, women, minorities, and first generation scholars --- to [propose a presentation](proposal) and/or [register for attendance](attendance). 

Similarly, the series is wide open to theoretical as well as empirical studies, qualitative as well as quantitative research, null as well as significant results, and so on.

### Supportive

<i>Re</i>:Presentations is designed with supporting scholars in mind, and we believe in the power of constructive feedback on research in progress. 

This is why the organisers will: 
- read every paper and provide presenters with written feedback
- invite scholars best placed to support a given paper to act as discussant, and
- encourage constructive feedback from others in attendance

### Dynamic

The series is open to change, to achieve a more inclusive and more supportive environment where scholarly work on anything representation can be discussed.

<i>Re</i>:Presentations will adapt to your demands, constantly reassess what works and what does not --- as to how and how often we organise the series and individual meetings.
